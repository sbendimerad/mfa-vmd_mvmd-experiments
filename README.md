# mfa-vmd_mvmd-experiments
Experiments combining Multifractal Analysis (MFA) with Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) and Multivariate VMD (MVMD) to investigate scale-invariance and signal decomposition.

This repository contains a series of experiments designed to explore the combination of **Multifractal Analysis (MFA)** with **Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD)** and its multivariate extension (**MVMD**).

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The primary goal is to test and analyze how VMD and MVMD can improve or interact with multifractal analysis methods â€” particularly on real-world and simulated signals. This project is part of a broader research effort to enhance signal processing techniques in complex biomedical or geophysical datasets.
